# Who I am?

My name is Alexandr Shurigin. I'm a professional full-stack engineer who develops web applications (including backend and frontend tasks), API endpoints, automation tools, payment gateways, scraping tools, custom protocol implementations, manages Linux servers and handles a lot of other various tasks. My work has helped countless clients around the world to bring their ideas and software to life, and when you hire me, I'll do the same for you.

# About me

I love to create, and my favorite way to do this is through web development that fulfills a client’s need or solves a client’s problem. I’m passionate about fast, well-written, user-friendly applications. Providing clients with high-quality apps that meet their business needs is my top priority.

I excel at solving technical problems using Python, PHP, and JavaScript, and I also build expert applications from scratch in these languages. Furthermore, I am a skilled web developer and team leader with professional experience that includes network engineering, mobile applications development, full stack engineering, and more.

I have helped many clients to find solutions to their problems. My successes include:

* Created stable, fast, fully-functional architecture for FloraExpress.
* Creating an efficient CRM system for order processing at a staff and call center that increased productivity and reduced costs.
* Developing a fully-functional REST API server with 130 API functions (standard is 15; a large app typically doesn’t exceed 80).
* Developing a Google Chrome extension to save time and automate tasks.
* Helping to popularize web developer Garenne Bigby’s service by fixing an average of 3-5 bugs per month, adding features, and increasing speed to surpass competitors.

My career in IT began in 2004 when I started working as a university network engineer, and since that time, I have learned 10 programming languages and various technologies. My specialties include PHP (11 years), Python (5 years), JavaScript with NodeJS (11 years), HTML/CSS (11 years), and Linux LAMP/LEMP administration (12 years). I am also a middle in C# and Java, but I use them only as console applications and libraries because I prefer web applications rather than system GUI apps.

One of my clients described me by saying, “If you are looking for an innovative developer with fresh ideas, [Alexandr] would be an excellent choice to add to your team. He succeeds where I have seen other Python developers fail and he makes it look easy.” This quote encapsulates who I am. I never give up and I always push myself to create innovative solutions that solve real-world problems. I look forward to doing the same for you.

## What I executed?

I’ve executed a wide variety of projects for clients, including the following:

- Simple websites
- Web Applications with various features starting from user registration & dashboard up to a predictive recommendation system (machine learning texts classification) based on user actions history.
- eCommerce platforms build on microservices architecture
- Portal systems which included 50+ screens.

## Portfolio

So often I work with signed NDA or for stealth mode startups so I can't show here everything, but I will try to show as much as possible.

**\* "via Upwork" means that you can check my [upwork profile](https://www.upwork.com/fl/alexandrshurigin) for more details about a project.**

1. **[Jogging Single Page Application](https://github.com/phpdude/portfolio-jogging-django-react-webpack-docker)** - Portfolio project: jogging application built with Django, ReactJS, Webpack and Docker containers. I specially built it to show my skills and source code quality.
1. [Full Stack Development & DevOps Engineer with Continuous Integration](http://www.spiralai.com/en/) **via Upwork**.
  The client needed to migrate from Google App Engine to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Docker Multi-Containers infrastructure. This required rewriting a significant amount of source code that depended on Google App Engine API.  I rewrote a significant portion of the project and made all deployment processes as simple as possible with shippable.com CI. I found alternatives and rewrote all source code for Google App Engine APIs: URLfetch, geocoding, XMPP proxy, Cloud SQL, Async tasks, deferred tasks, and cache. I also rewrote many unity tests to test all migration process results.  

  At the end of the project, the client received:

  * Shippable configuration for CI and auto-deploy staging/production configurations and tests evaluation
  * All source code migrated to existing open-source solutions that works like Google App Engine API
  * Bug-free and updated source code

  My work allowed the client to move forward with his project and reduce hosting costs.

  CLIENT TESTIMONIAL

  > Alex is a great developer and sysadmin. He showed great flexibility and accountability during the project. I would recommend him for any job that involves sysadmin, docker and python skills.

1. [Stealth Mode iOS/Mobile Commerce Silicon Valley Startup](https://www.upwork.com/fl/alexandrshurigin) **via Upwork**. The client required backend API architecture for mobile application with geolocation, payments, and shipment integration. I delivered a working app that had all of these features. I also hired an iOS developer contractor for the client and managed a small team until the application was completed. The client received a working prototype and used it to secure another round of investment.

  CLIENT TESTIMONIAL

  > “I’ve worked with Alex on multiple projects and have been amazed at the quality of his work and his professionalism. His work is definitely top shelf material and he takes great pride in making sure of this. He is extremely easy to work with and can handle any stressful situation before him. Ambiguity is no concern for Alex! I’m also impressed with his communication skills as he makes sure to focus on his clients’ needs and puts any concerns to rest by walking them through risks and providing alternative solutions. I’ve considered myself very lucky to have worked with Alex and hope to work more with him in the future.”

1. [Django Deploy Fixes & Bug Fixed With Some Features](http://www.thelarstrandnyc.com/) **via Upwork**.
  The client’s website stopped working upon switching to a new hosting provider. I fixed all deploy configuration issues so that the website would work properly. Once the website went live, I fixed numerous problems, including bad validation of forms data. I also adjusted email settings configuration, including SPF and DKIM configuration with auto forwarding to company's staff. As result, the client’s website is now functional and able to generate leads.

  CLIENT TESTIMONIALS

  > 1.  Great quality of work and outstanding communication skills!
  >
  >     Strongly recommending!
  >
  > 1. I like everything about my experience working with this particular contractor: knowledge, communication, quality of work, availability, professionalism. Extremely happy with his work! Everything has been fixed even faster then I could expect! Thank You!

1. [Visual Sitemap Generator - Dyno Mapper](http://dynomapper.com/) via Freelancer.com. The client needed to fix bugs and add features to a backend Scrapy project tool that is used to crawl websites.  I added approximately 60 features, including login support for standard HTTP authorization methods, popular CMS engines, and custom client engines. We moved from a standalone dedicated server to AWS autoscaling Docker containers deployment processes. My work gracefully improved crawler speed and accuracy. I added extra caching layers, database bulk writes, and temporary storage for crawling time data to Redis and MongoDB. The crawler now works without any bottlenecks and can crawl websites in about 15 parallel threads, providing an amazing user experience.  This project has increased lead generation and boosted the popularity of the client's service.

  CLIENT TESTIMONIAL

1. [CRM & POS systems development / Magento Optimization / Linux Support](http://www.heygidday.biz/) via Freelancer.com. This project encompassed a wide variety of tasks, including simple template work, simple PHP work, developing software from scratch, creating an inventory management CRM, developing a Point of Sale system from scratch, optimizing performance, cleaning source code from spaghetti, and integrating with 3rd party services such as ShipStation, Amazon, eBay, PayPal API, PayPal Payflow Pro, and others.  I built an amazing CRM and POS with all required features and integrations, which has reduced the client’s spending on staff costs. These systems have also allowed the client to spend less time on business management because all areas of business now are automated. This has freed the client up to grow his business, open a brick-and-mortar showroom, and makes more sales than before.  

  CLIENT TESTIMONIAL

  > “Alex is a GREAT programmer. I have repeatedly retained his services for my private business interests (not for my employer) and he has produced prompt and expert work every time. I have learnt that I can count on his expertise every time. I also love that for many items I have wished programming for that other programmers have said that were not possible, Alex delivered them. Wow!! I have used Alex primarily in the areas of developing my Cake PHP tools, but he is very fluent in many areas, I am sure I barely use his skills. Thanks Alex!!”

1. [Attune.co API Python Client](https://github.com/attune-api/attune-python) **via Upwork**. The client had API webservice as a main project feature and wanted to have an API client written using the Python language.  I built a strong API client with features such as auto-retry on 5xx errors, a circuit breaking pattern to avoid DDoS on API web service if that has increasing errors count, Async/sync execution of API, unit-tested features, and additional features. All of this was completed within two weeks and all deadlines were met.

  The client received an exceptional Python client and has begun to use it with his web service business clients.

  CLIENT TESTIMONIAL
  > Alexandr produced very well written code.  Very readable, well structured and commented. Great Python skills employing lamdas and multi-threading.
  >
  > Alexandr worked late hours to deliver my project in time.  Great talent!

1. **Google Chrome Plugin** **via Upwork**. The client required a Google Chrome extension to perform an automation "change and control IP task" to prevent being banned when the same cookie appears on multiple IPs. This plugin saved the client a  significant amount of time and prevents him from being blocked by a target service due to an IP conflict.

  CLIENT TESTIMONIAL
  > Excellent.  Perfect on all fronts. Alexandr did a really amazing job quickly and with great communication. I look forward to hiring him again in the future.

1. [Full Stack, Linux & DevOps Engineer & Scrum Owner at FloraExpress](https://www.floraexpress.ru/). The client required a project manager to build from scratch a dedicated CRM system with REST API endpoints and approximately seven of the company's clients applications. I oversaw the build of a CRM system, three versions of the primary eCommerce website, two additional eCommerce websites, two payment gateways, mobile applications, several mobile websites designed from scratch (not responsive versions of the main websites), and many additional tools and utilities.  I used best practices to perform all required tasks. All elements of the project have been deployed; they are now live and generating leads.  

  As result of my work, the client now many new business instruments that generate leads and increase customer satisfaction. My work led to an increase in orders from 25/day to 80/day.  Additionally, I built a stable platform with 99.99% SLA, DDoS protection, all infrastructure configuration,  automated deployment, version control, and various features.
